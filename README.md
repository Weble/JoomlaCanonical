# JoomlaCanonical
Joomla System Plugin to remove path and fragment from the canonical url generated by the system SEF plugin.
The core system SEF plugin appens query and fragment to the url, which is ok if you don't use SEF urls.
If you do and take great care to make sure your urls don't contain any extra query parameter for no reason, then the query and fragment part are not useful, and can lead to duplicate urls (like urls with `?utm_source=`).
This plugin fixes that issue by simply removing the canonical url query and fragment parts

# Installation
1) Install through the joomla installer
2) Activate the plugin
3) Order the plugin **AFTER** the `System - SEF` plugin.
4) Check that you set the `website domain` parameter in the `System - SEF` plugin to your current website's domain
